## Yet Another Github Util ‚õè

Yeah, yeah, I know. Another dumb script project that's overly specific and not all that reusable. But, isn't that how all great things are started?

## How do you run this thing? ü§î

1. Clone the repo locally
2. Go to the root dir
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm script.js`

## Todo

[ ] ... hmmm
